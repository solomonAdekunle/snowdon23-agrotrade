## üìß Email Best Practices

1. **Response Time:** Aim to send quotes within 24 hours
2. **Follow Up:** If no response in 3-5 days, send a friendly follow-up
3. **File Naming:** When saving filled templates, use descriptive names:
   - `quote-2025-001-john-smith-cashew.html`
4. **Archive:** Keep copies of sent quotes for reference

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Styling looks broken in Gmail
**Solution:** Some email clients strip styles. The templates are designed to work, but if you see issues:
- Try copying from Chrome browser instead of Firefox
- Make sure you're pasting in the email body, not as plain text

### Problem: Buttons not clickable
**Solution:** The links are there, they just might not look like buttons. Recipients can still click them.

### Problem: Need to add more details
**Solution:** Edit the HTML directly:
- Find the section you want to modify
- Add your content following the same style pattern
